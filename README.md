# Thermometer
Thermometer software for Arduino.
Requires LM35 thermal sensor and three leds (green, yellow, red).
Hardware for this one was built from surplus parts. Thanks Helena for those and guidance with electrical stuff.
This was my first monday evening Arduino project.

If red light is on, temperature is below -0,5 Celsius.  
If yellow light is on, temperature is -0,5 â€” 0,5 Celsius.  
If green light is on, temperature is above 0,5 Celsius.
